# kali-rolling-luks2-VM-guide
I am going to demonstrate how to use debootstrap to build kali-rolling on a VirtualBox VM. While in chroot, I will demonstrate how to compile grub2 with ArchLinux's grub-improved-luks2 that allows me to encrypt the root system with argon2id password hashing algorithm. Lastly, I will demonstrate how to sign vmlinuz and grub bootloader
